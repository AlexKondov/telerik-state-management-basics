# Telerik State Management Basics 2021 Examples

This repository contains the code examples from my lecture on state management with React. Some of them are intentionally oversimplified, while other may be more complex than needed. This is done for the sake of illustrating a specific point and may not be a good representation of production quality code.

Each app is scaffolded with Create React App and you should be able to run them with `npm i` and `npm start`. There is some default styling that is of questionable quality, but should be good enough to get an idea of what is happening on the screen.
